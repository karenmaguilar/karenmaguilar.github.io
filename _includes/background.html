      I am currently a Research Engineer at the 
      <a class="underline-link" href="https://newtlab.ece.uw.edu/" target="_blank">NEWT Lab</a> at the University of Washington, where I focus on developing multimodal sensing systems that integrate imaging, embedded hardware, and machine learning. I recently completed my M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the 
      <a class="underline-link" href="https://www.ece.uw.edu/" target="_blank">University of Washington</a>, where my work centered on polarimetric imaging and data-driven modeling for estimating soil moisture via visible light polarimetry.

      My research interests lie at the intersection of sensor design, human-centered computing, and environmental technologies. I am particularly interested in building robust, scalable, and interpretable systems that operate reliably in real-world conditions. I aim to contribute to solutions that improve accessibility, sustainability, and scientific understanding through intelligent sensing.

      <strong>Outside the lab</strong>, I enjoy visual storytelling through design, creating educational tools, and engaging in outreach efforts to support diversity in STEM.
